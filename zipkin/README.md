## Core Library
The core library is used by both Zipkin instrumentation and the Zipkin server. Its minimum Java language level is 6, in efforts to support those writing agent instrumentation.

This includes built-in codec for Zipkin's v1 and v2 json formats. A direct dependency on gson (json library) is avoided by minifying and repackaging classes used. The result is a 155k jar which won't conflict with any library you use.

Ex.
```java
// All data are recorded against the same endpoint, associated with your service graph
localEndpoint = Endpoint.newBuilder().serviceName("tweetie").ip("192.168.0.1").build()
span = Span.newBuilder()
    .traceId("d3d200866a77cc59")
    .id("d3d200866a77cc59")
    .name("targz")
    .localEndpoint(localEndpoint)
    .timestamp(epochMicros())
    .duration(durationInMicros)
    .putTag("compression.level", "9");

// Now, you can encode it as json
bytes = SpanBytesEncoder.JSON_V2.encode(span);
```

Note: The above is just an example, most likely you'll want to use an existing tracing library like [Brave](https://github.com/openzipkin/brave)
